<h2>About the Code</h2>
<p>
<b>Driver controlled:</b>
For our driver-controlled period, we created a mecanum drive code. This allows us to move left and right without having to turn. It works by creating a coordinate system and finding the direction of the joystick.
</p>
<p>
<b>Autonomous:</b>
All of the robotâ€™s components are defined in the <code>Hardware.java</code> file. Some functions, such as the one to move in any direction, are also defined in this file. We did this so that we could simply call <code>robot.init()</code> to configure the robot. It allows us to create new autonomous programs faster. We have four autonomous programs; two for each alliance. We did this so that the robot does not have to be in a specific position to work during the autonomous period. All of our autonomous programs place two preloaded pixels and park backstage.
